                <h2 class="about-text">...and what we do!</h2>
                <p class="about-text">BOSSA & MORNA is the result of an unexpected friendship between three musicians with different musical backgrounds. This friendship allowed the convergence of
                Africa, Brazilian and Portuguese music into an energetic outburst of good feelings which brings the joyest of feelings to the listener.
                <br>The goal is to pay tribute to the amazing music that has been created trought the years by these portuguese-speaking areas of the globe. There's no reason to give the areas names because 
                their music is exactly about freedom and enjoying life.
                Their influences go from a broad range of artists from Cesária Évora and Tito Paris from African to Roberto Carlos and Djavan from Brazilian passing by Sara Tavares and António Zambujo.
                <br>Three voices and three instruments which will guarantee a very good time!<br>
                <br>
                The work wouldn't be complete without an album so we are preparing one for our fans. Soon "Encontros" will be available for everyone who wants to enjoy our music, for you not to miss it we 
                are allowing fans to pre-order it so don't hesitate and be one of the first to get it!<br>

                <p class="about-text">Diogo Caetano is a one man band but his true love is guitar. He wasn't always a musician, before deciding to embrace his true calling Diogo worked as a 
                sound technician for several music festivals and events. This gave him a very good insight on the music industry before deciding to make it his full-time job.
                Currently he is playing in three bands: "Bossa & Morna" which is the band this page is about, "ZukaTuga" which is also a lusophone project with the same elements but in a 
                different format because they only play original songs produced by them and "TopNotch" which is a project where he has an opportunity to plays covers his teenage favourite bands like Sublime,
                Offspring, Ben Harper and many others.<br>
                For the last 10 years Diogo has gained a lot of experience playing live alone using loops and samples to complete his set, that's what makes him a one man band. He can give a whole show 
                with only his guitar, a drumpad and of course his precious loop station.

                "Black Nepal" he started getting into the good vibes provided by brazilian styles like Bossa Nova, Forró, baião and many other. That was the moment he gathered a few other 
                guest musicians to record an album fully produced by him, the project was called "Takinareia". He also has a special place in his heart for portuguese music as he, along 
                with another musician, start "Dois Rios" mixing Fado with portuguese Popular Music. You can also see him playing the bass since, in order to achieve higher goals of his career,
                he doesn't limit himself to guitar.<br>
                Now his main projects are "Bossa & Morna" and "ZukaTuga" but he also plays alone in private events and teaches any level of guitar and bass.

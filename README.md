### Strategy
The goal of this website's design is to provide a good user experience when navigating through the website looking for the desired information or content. The navigation should be straight forward
as every page has a link on the navigation bar which displays in all of them.

### Scope
The information is displayed thinking about the three main users of this website. Everything is organized in order to make it fluid for everyone, giving them an oportunity to perform the desired task and receive additonal and useful information.

### Structure
The structure was thought to be fluid. When the user enters the website, immediately has an overview of all the sections available going from home to a contact us pages.
On the Home page, the first thing that is shown is the fact that a new album will be released and that a pre-order can be submitted with a button that links to the related page.
Then there's a page about the band so that the user can have more insight on what the band is all about and a small biography on each of the musicians.
Gallery is divided in videos and pictures.
Then there are two forms, one to pre-order the new album and to contact the band. These two pages are linked by a side area with links between both of them.
